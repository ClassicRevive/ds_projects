The difference for them can be significant. A 10-year loan of €50,000 from
you at zero interest would involve monthly payments of €417, or €5,000 a
year. With An Post’s market-leading rate, the friend would be paying
€525.45 a month, or over €6,300 a year and over €13,000 interest over the
life of the loan.

To test the effectiveness of this sentence boundary detector, let's try some special cases!!!
Ironic huh? That was a special case... So is this, and this too! Pi being 3.14159 is not really an edge case. Two more things:
The capital of U.s.a. is Washington DC, but that isn't the end of a sentence! And George W. Bush was the 43rd president of America, but that wasn't a sentence ending either. How will we deal with those pesky edge cases???
Disclaimer: All characters are ficitonal. I went to Dr. Larry because I had a sore head, and he said Prof. Phillip's and Mrs. Mcgeoghs books had an antidote for that. I.e. liquid ibuprofen.
J. K. Rowling wrote Harry Potter, but those initials didn't end the sentence. But if I tell you my grade in my Irish exams, that should end the sentence right? I got a B. That didn't end the sentence though; But we just had to make that tradeoff...
