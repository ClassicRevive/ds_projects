      "recently a peer , a fellow young filmmaker , informed me that he had an idea for a movie about four guys , the mob , and the fbi . \n",
      "it occurred to me then what's wrong with indies like suicide kings : i suspect o'fallon has never met a mobster , is not a rich man , doesn't deliver endless \" clever \" monologues to his friends about his favourite types of boots . . . \n",

      "there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director . \n",
      "of course , his best film was 1978's masterpiece , \" halloween , \" but he also made 1980's \" the fog , \" and 1987's underrated , \" prince of darkness . \" \n",
      "heck , he even made a good film in 1995 , with \" in the mouth of madness . \" \n",
      "but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 , with the terrible comedy , \" memoirs of an invisible man . \" \n",
      "somehow , carpenter has lost his touch , with junk like his failed 1995 remake of , \" village of the damned , \" to his uninspired 1996 sequel , \" escape from l . a . \" those movies , however , look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film , \" john carpenter's vampires . \" \n",
      "if i was him , i definately wouldn't want to put my own name in the title . \n",
      "it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as , \" vampires . \" \n",
      "the story is simple . \n",
      "jack crow ( james woods ) is a vampire hunter who , along with one of his partners , montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and a prostitute , katrina ( sheryl lee ) , survives an attack from the master vampire , valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . \n",
      "since katrina was previously bitten by him , crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later , and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her . \n",
      "it seems valek's mission is to steal a black , wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him . \n",
      "my question is : how many time have we seen this same story played out ? \n",
      "well , the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made . \n",
      " \" john carpenter's vampires , \" sadly enough , is one of the most unscary horror films i've ever seen . \n",
      "in fact , there isn't even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time . \n",
      "the non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter's . \n",
      "and then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is nearly non-existent . \n",
      "there is no story development , and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the characters . \n",
      "james woods can be a good actor , but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of \" pseudo \" -clever lines of dialogue . \n",
      "daniel baldwin has some potential , but his character comes off as being very dense . \n",
      "and sheryl lee ( faring much better as laura palmer in \" twin peaks \" ) , like all of the female characters , plays an offensive stereotypical whore . \n",
      "there is not an ounce of intelligence , or excitement in , \" john carpenter's vamires , \" which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan of carpenter's . \n",
      "he has said that he turned down directing , \" halloween : h20 , \" because he couldn't work up any excitement for it . \n",
      "and yet , when asked about a \" vampires \" sequel , he said he would be happy to do it . \n",
      "i think that's a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent , not to mention a significant number of iq points . \n",
