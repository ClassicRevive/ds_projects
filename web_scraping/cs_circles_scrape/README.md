## Computer Science Circles web scrape



In this mini-project, I will scrape some webpages from the Computer Science Circles website and extract dataset. The saved data is stored in the "data" folder.



In "main.py" I extracted the following:

- Menu of contents

  Scraped the menu of contents and reformatted the sections.

  displayed the sections in a tidy format. Didn't extract in a file

- Word count dataset

  Scraped all the text on the home page, cleaned the textual data and then constructed a word count data frame to be read out as CSV.
  
  Observed that the most common words were conjunctions, prepositions, and words which you would most likely find in a programming article such as:
  {arguement, weight, code, x, program, max, Python}
