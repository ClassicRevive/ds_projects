## Assignment 3 (Recommender System)



In this Assignment, I built a recommender system for artists based on the user's listening preferences.



To view the code without running, see [rec_work.html](read_only/rec_work.html). For PDF form, see [rec_work.pdf](read_only/rec_work.pdf)

The [rec_work.ipynb](rec_work.ipynb) notebook allows you to test the recommender system with your own artist preferences. See Section 3.1 in that file for more details on how to do so.
