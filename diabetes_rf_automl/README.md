### Assignment 1 – Random Forest and AutoML
The dataset for this project is the “Pima Indians Diabetes Database”. This dataset is available
here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
(Note the text below is taken from the Kaggle website)


**The Data**
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient
has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several
constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In
particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable,
Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their
BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

**Your challenge**
Can you build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in
the dataset have diabetes or not?

**Constraints:** I wish to see you attempt the challenge two ways:
**Method 1:** Using a Random Forest classifier
**Method 2:** Using an automated ML method via PyCaret

Write up your work as a Jupyter notebook which you must contain clear
commentary and code and should be executable by your examiner. I would like to see that
you provide some commentary which gives the reader an idea of how AutoML works in
general and how PyCaret works particularly (you can spend around 1000 words or 2 “A4
pages” or so doing that if you like – use your own words and thoughts here).
You will add a discussion section to this notebook in which you highlight the differences you
see between your automated approach and your original hand engineered random forest
attempt (500 word limit for this final discussion section – not a hard limit by the way). You
will be providing a critical evaluation of the two approaches here.
