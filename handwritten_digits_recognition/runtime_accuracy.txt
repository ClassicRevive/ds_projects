Thes runtimes are for running KNN algorithm to classify digits from digits dataset.
Runtimes taken from lab machine

10k randomly generated 1's and 10k randomly generated 7's.
initial 7 model version (potential overlaps between cross stroke and top stroke)
Time: 185s
Confusion matrix:
       labels
results   1   7
      1 956 223
      7  44 777


10k randomly generated 1's and 10k 7's
improved 7's model
Time: 186.09"
Confusion matrix:
       labels
results   1   7
      1 973 195
      7  27 805
alot less misclassified 1's, slightly less misclassified 7's


10k 1's and 7's from multivariate normal models
# Time: 197.66 (on this laptop)
Confusion matrix (k=1)
      labels
results    1    7
      1 1000   33
      7    0  967
accuracy: 98.35% (k=1), 98.65% (k=5)


100k randomly generated 1's and 100k 7's, box method with box size = 300
initial 7 model
Time: 110s
Confusion matrix:

100k randomly generated 1's and 100k 7's box method with box size = 500
improved 7 model
Time: 261s
Confusion matrix:
       labels
results   1   7
      1 997  71
      7   3 929
accuracy (high): 96.3%


10k randomly generated 1's with two stage method
initial 7 model
Time: 142s
Confusion matrix:
       labels
results   1   7
      1 895  49
      7 105 951
lower 7 misclassification rate, slightly higher 1 misclassification.
high rate of overlapping cross stroke and upper stroke with 7's causing misclassified 1's
preventing overlap with an improved 7 model can increase the accuracy.


100k randomly generated 1's with the two-stage method
initial 7 model
Time: 244s
Confusion matrix:
       labels
results   1   7
      1 907  52
      7  93 948
Slight accuracy improvement but not an efficient optimisation.
