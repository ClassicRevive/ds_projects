This project was from a the class CA274, Programming for Data Analysis in R

In this project, I tried classifying handwritten digit images using KNN. I then tried a number of optimizations
to improve the model such as PCA, Box methods, and Gaussian Blurring. After this, I focused on creating models to
generate realistic looking digits (1's, 2's, 7's, and 4's). I found key insights about the patterns in how different strokes
of these digits are drawn and used this to improve the synthetic images, improving classification model. I included a file 
showing runtimes and confusion matrices for different methods used. There were some extra bits which wern't included here
Such as an alternative 7's model and a two-stage classification method.
