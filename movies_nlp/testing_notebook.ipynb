      "a number of critics have decided that it's open season on freddie prize jr . , slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound-alike , disposable teen fluff like \" head over heels , \" \" boys and girls , \" \" down to you \" and \" she's all that . \" \n",
      "while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend , his talent is not . \n",
      "i first saw him in the independent dark comedy \" the house of yes , \" where he gave a subtle , impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america's freakiest families . \n",
      "prinze has the acting chops ; he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown-up movies to show the non-believers that he has what it takes . \n",
      " \" summer catch \" certainly won't help his case . \n",
      "inoffensive , but utterly generic , the baseball-related romantic comedy does little more than kill time . \n",
      "the story deals with the love affair between tenley ( jessica biel ) , a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan ( prinze ) , a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a big-time baseball star . \n",
      "ryan's preoccupation with his new honey-bunny drives her elitist father ( bruce davison ) crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team . \n",
      "it's a wonder the kid has any time to pitch , as his time is occupied with making out with tenley , fighting with her dad , bonding with his own dad ( fred ward , who deserves better than this ) , fighting with his brother ( jason gedrick ) and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates . \n",
      "the filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky , character-heavy baseball movie like \" bull durham , \" but haven't got a clue how to get there . \n",
      "and so they glide from one clich ? to the next for 108 minutes . \n",
      "the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a center-fielder from texas . \n",
      "in an early barroom scene , blucas , best known as demon-fighting riley finn from \" buffy the vampire slayer , \" hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass , then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states , \" he does have a nice ass . \n",
      "a bubble butt . \" \n",
      "when lillard gives him an \" are you insane ? \" \n",
      "look , blucas calmly says , \" it's nothing sexual , \" then goes on to evaluate the hind-ends of some other players , including lillard's . \n",
      "speaking of asses , prinze does not bare his in the movie . \n",
      "the actor has a no nudity clause in his contract , so two stunt-butts were employed for a couple of semi-nude shots . \n",
      "blucas , whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story , gets another unique moment late in the film . \n",
      "sick of hearing teammates make \" fat chick \" jokes , he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amply-sized ladies . \n",
      "while his speech still ends up objectifying women , it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie . \n",
      "trivial tidbit : \" summer catch \" marks a scooby doo summit . \n",
      "marc blucas appears in \" jay and silent bob strike back \" as fred from the scooby doo gang , while freddie prinze jr . plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon . \n",

      "steven spielberg's second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film . \n",
      "spielberg , ever the student on film , has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest , and most powerful entries . \n",
      "he also managed to cast this era's greatest answer to jimmy stewart , tom hanks , who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle . \n",
      "for about 160 out of its 170 minutes , \" saving private ryan \" is flawless . \n",
      "literally . \n",
      "the plot is simple enough . \n",
      "after the epic d-day invasion ( whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular ) , capt . john miller ( hanks ) and his team are forced to search for a pvt . \n",
      "james ryan ( damon ) , whose brothers have all died in battle . \n",
      "once they find him , they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home . \n",
      "accompanying miller are his crew , played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational . \n",
      "barry pepper , adam goldberg , vin diesel , giovanni ribisi , davies , and burns are the team sent to find one man , and bring him home . \n",
      "the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary . \n",
      "literally . \n",
      "there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film's first 20 minutes . \n",
      "spielberg films almost the entire movie without music , leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion , and they do to perfection . \n",
      "the sequences in france , all of them , beginning with the battle and ending with the battle , are fabulous , especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides , trying to save private ryan . \n",
      "there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences . \n",
      "this is what coppola was looking for in \" apocalypse now \" , but couldn't create . \n",
      "the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war . \n",
      "the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary . \n",
      "he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world , with his comic timing , dramatic flair , his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears . \n",
      "hanks is this country's finest actor , and he proves it here . \n",
      "however , spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece . \n",
      "with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time , spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film . \n",
      "the sequence involving army chief-of-stafff george marshall and mrs . ryan is decent , but doesn't hold up to the rest of the film , relying on wartime cliches to power it . \n",
      "but that is forgivable . \n",
      "what isn't is the bookends of the film , the cemetary sequences . \n",
      "the first one is quite good , a decent introduction into the lives of these men . \n",
      "the last sequence is atrocious . \n",
      "the forced emotion , accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music , is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film . \n",
      "these flaws are what downgrade \" ryan \" from the greatest film of our era , to the greatest war film of our era . \n",
      "spielberg should have trusted his own material , and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie , to end his masterpiece right there . \n",
      "the use of the flag , though patriotic , is in contrast to the movie's theme . \n",
      "the power of the bulk of the film , however , is astonishing . \n",

      "insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america . \n",
      "as the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold . \n",
      "throughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of `ute' indians that doesn't seem quite on the mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism . \n",
      "parker obviously knows his musicals very well , because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film ( he would accomplish this again in his post-cannibal ! \n",
      "musical motion picture , south park : bigger , longer , and uncut ) . \n",
      "apart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre- \" south park \" parker and stone in their first effort , cannibal ! \n",
      "also offers up some pretty decent laughs . \n",
      "the aforementioned `ute' indian tribe that packer's group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note ) . \n",
      "stone's humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt' or revealing what's underneath his muff cap . \n",
      "jason mchugh's character of mr . miller is the stand out performance though , as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings . \n",
      "as i mentioned before , parker's songs are very catchy . \n",
      "you'll be hard pressed to get `it's a shpadoinkle day' out of your head once you've heard it ( incidentally , the braniff logo that appears at the end of every \" south park \" episode is scored with a few notes from this song ) . \n",
      "other songs you'll find yourself humming include `when i was on top of you' ( a love ballad ) , `the trapper's song' ( the villains leit motif ) , and `hang the bastard' ( the rousing finale ) . \n",
      "thankfully , none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park : bigger , longer & uncut's songs are . \n",
      "released as a pick-up through troma studios , the film is available on videocassette and dvd . \n",
      "the videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman , discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film ( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball ) . \n",
      "there are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films . \n",
      "as for the dvd . . . \n",
      "well , that's a different story . \n",
      "probably one of the best dvd packages of the year ( and potentially of all time ) , cannibal ! \n",

      "the dvd is a massive achievement . \n",
      "presented in 1 . 33 : 1 ( full frame ) only , the disc has the usual troma inclusions : the tour of troma , the troma intelligence test 2 , trailers for upcoming releases , but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal ! \n",
      "specific extras . \n",
      "the first thing i must note is , the transfer is about as beautiful as any i've ever seen on any disc . \n",
      "the picture is crisp , clear , and free from any noticeable artifacts . \n",
      "add to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard , featuring trey parker , matt stone , jason mchugh , dian bachar , and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still haven't scratched the surface of the extras . \n",
      "there's also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film , a clip with trey , matt , and lemmy ( of the band motorhead ) from the film terror firmer , an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film , and finally , an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal ! . \n",

      "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \n",
      "be forewarned . \n",
      "at the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere . \n",
      "this highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture . \n",
      "and with good reason . \n",
      "this is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . \n",
      "remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin . \n",
      " ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) \n",
      "uma thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . \n",
      "unfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship . \n",
      "at this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . \n",
      "the duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot . \n",
      "when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent . \n",
      "if nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . \n",
      "the story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption . \n",
      " ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) \n",
      "overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . \n",
      "the avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it's all decidedly uncompelling . \n",
      "mr . connery , who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . \n",
      "at least it all looks good . \n",
      "this is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . \n",
      "in particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . \n",
      "there are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . \n",
      "by the time the film's climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . \n",
      "not coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . \n",
      "it's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining . \n",
      "a crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies . \n",
      "there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not . \n",

      "a new entry in the \" revisionist history \" genre of filmmaking , dick suggests that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation's biggest presidential scandal . \n",
      "kirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene's watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across g . gordon liddy ( played dead-on by harry shearer ) and the infamous break-in . \n",
      "when they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip , they are ushered into a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as official presidential dog walkers . \n",
      "the girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with . \n",
      "when they discover that nixon ( another dead-on performance by dan hedaya , who actually favors nixon slightly , unlike anthony hopkins ) has been abusive to checkers , the presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they quit and become disillusioned . \n",
      "during a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president's resignation . \n",
      "this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king-type talk show ( featuring a cameo by french stewart ) about revealing the identity of \" deep throat \" . \n",
      "from there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad \" dick \" joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy . \n",
      "at one point , the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial . \n",
      "the band manages to stop right as dunst screams \" you have to stop letting dick run your life ! \" \n",
      "much to the horror of everyone standing within earshot . \n",
      "several other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film . \n",
      "if this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault it's juvenile bathroom humor , but it's not . \n",
      "the film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience's throat in the least subtle way possible . \n",
      "i don't recall oliver stone's nixon having to pander to it's audience , but of course that film wasn't a comedy aimed squarely at a 13-20 year-old film going audience . \n",
      "the only redeeming thing about this movie is it's remarkable supporting cast . \n",
      "i wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch's woodward and bernstein . \n",
      "those two characters are the sole basis for my rating . \n",
      "i wish they had been given more screen time , but unfortunately , they are only relegated to the final half-hour . \n",
      "their constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight , especially mcculloch's constant thwarting of ferrell's attempts to gather information from the girls ( who , in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat , so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy's brother ) . \n",
      "the other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters , but are given nothing to work with . \n",
      "i'd like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities . \n",
      "as for the two leads , dunst and williams can definitely do better . \n",
      "they come off as what could best be described as romy and michele : the early years in this particular film , a highly dubious distinction at best . \n",
      "stay through the first half of the end credits though , to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie . \n",
      "an excellent idea marred by poor execution , dick could have been a great movie . \n",
      "less of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes , could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds . \n",
      "as it stands though , dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as \" dick and poopie \" jokes . \n",

      "i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of \" runners \" sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery . \n",
      "this was the way of life in harlem , and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table . \n",

      "armageddon , in itself , symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking . \n",
      "stories have been replaced with special effects ; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue ; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up . \n",
      "armageddon is as stupid , as loud and as shallow as any movie you'll see come out this summer , or maybe even any other summer . \n",
      "but i loved every freaking minute of it . \n",
      "believe me , i'm just as shocked as you are . \n",
      "hell , i don't even know why i went to see it in the first place . \n",
      "the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year , or at least in the running . \n",
      "i'm sorry , but \" somebody dial 911 ! ! ! \" \n",
      "isn't quite the tagging that's going to sell a movie . \n",
      "it isn't too wise either to market the film using the movie's stupidest lines ( \" beam me up scotty \" - yeah , that sure is great writing . . . ) . \n",
      "i mean , let's face it ; armageddon's previews rival the truman show's as being some of the worst of the year . \n",
      "neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice . \n",
      "of course , you all know the story . \n",
      "when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas , nasa calls in the us's top oil drillers ( ! ) to go into space ( ! ) and implant a nuclear device eight-hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid ( ! ) . \n",
      "in the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters . \n",
      "belonging to the former group is rockhound ( steve buscemi ) , a horny little womanizing genius who's always full of wisecracks , even when flying into space at a huge amount of g's . \n",
      "also , there's the always cool-as-hell billy bob thornton as dan truman , the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers . \n",
      "he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 , only without the intensity and great lines to deliver . \n",
      "then on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can't quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie . \n",
      "basically , that's about it . \n",
      "as i said , this is hardly a film about plot . \n",
      "it's another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden . \n",
      "case in point : nasa doesn't know that there is even an asteroid on it's way until eighteen days before impact - huh ? \n",
      "another example : at one point in the movie , two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy . \n",
      "how pretentious is that ? ? ? ! ! ! \n",
      "want another one ? \n",
      "okay ; before the oil drillers blast off into space , one of them starts singing \" leaving on a jet plane \" , and soon , all the rest join in . \n",
      "did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ? \n",
      "but naturally , all this sappiness , melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin' time at the movies . \n",
      "and don't get me wrong - despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon , i still very much enjoyed it . \n",
